# Udacity React Fundamentals - MyReads Project

This is my project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. For this project, I had to build a main page with a book shelf that allows a user to keep track of books they are Currently Reading, Want to Read or Have Read. Additionally, you can search for books by clicking the green plus button and adding more from there. Enjoy!

To run this project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
